### Q: How should we approach the consistency of these thresholds over time?

**A:** Typically, thresholds remain fixed week-to-week, with exceptions in situations with multiple influenza peaks. The reason for this is to aim for stable, predictable, and simple monitoring. By using constant thresholds, it's easier to compare disease activity over different times. If thresholds changed every week, it could be hard to track and interpret, leading to inconsistencies.
